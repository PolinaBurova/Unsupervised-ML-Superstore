# Unsupervised-ML-Superstore

### Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors and demographic characteristics using clustering algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. The analysis reveals different customer profiles, enabling more targeted marketing strategies, better customer understanding, and improved business decisions.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `superstore_data.csv`.

## Notebook

The Jupyter notebook `Superstore_Unsupervised_ML.ipynb` contains the following sections:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations, correlation analysis, 
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, anomalies, outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Removing and adding new features.
4. **Data Pre-processing**: Applying MinMaxScaler, Encoding.
5. **Clustering ML Techniques**: Applying ML techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN.
6. **Summary**: Analysing the best ML technique and its results.
